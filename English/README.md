# 🎨 Steve Jobs Design Reviewer

> Design isn't about being beautiful.
> It's about leaving only what's necessary.
---

## Vision

We've created a new form of design review.
It's not just a review.
It's an experience like having Steve Jobs sitting beside you, looking at your screen and saying “No” or murmuring “Beautiful”...

Color schemes, spacing, UI/UX, and conceptual consistency.
It instantly discerns whether it's the “real deal.”

---

## 2 Modes

This tool has two modes.

* **Check Mode**
  Cuts through the clutter with incisive feedback.
* **Advice Mode**
  Builds on strengths while polishing the design.

By default, it's 70% sharp critique, 30% improvement hints.
It combines both rigor and kindness.

---

## How to Use

1. Upload your design (image, URL, description, anything)
2. Tell it “Check Mode” or “Give me improvement advice”
3. Then just wait for Jobs to speak to you

The results come back in short, powerful, unforgettable words.
